* puts

Use the 'puts' method to just write things to standard output.

What exactly does `dasherizes` do?

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  def dasherizes(string)
    string.tr("_+", "-")
  end
#+END_SRC

* how to puts

Throw in some `puts` and see.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  def dasherizes(string)
    puts "#" * 10
    puts string
    string.tr("_+", "-").tap do |s|
      puts s
      puts "#" * 10
    end
  end
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ##########
  hello+world_good_morning
  hello-world-good-morning
  ##########
#+END_EXAMPLE

* puts pros

Puts debugging is easy. There is nothing to learn, and nothing to
install. This is generally how new Ruby programmers get going.

* puts cons

- It requires a lot of typing
- Often you need to change methods, potentially introducing other bugs
- You tend to re-run the application over and over, tweaking your puts
- Remeber to remove all your puts!

* Use tools!

[[./tools.jpg]]

* Which tools?

There are a lot of debugging tools out there. If you google "how to
debug ruby" references to any of these tools might come up.

+ruby-debug+ Ruby 1.8
+debugger+ Ruby up to 1.9.3?
+debugger-pry+ No
+pry-debugger+ NO
+*debugger*+ _NO_
byebug Ruby 2+

* Install byebug

Install
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  gem install byebug
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or, in a Rails project just put it in the Gemfile

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  group :development, :test
    gem "byebug"
  end
#+END_SRC

* A simple byebug example

[[file:./simple_byebug/simple_byebug.rb][simple_byebug.rb]]

* byebug pros

The ability to set breakpoints, step into methods, view variables,
etc, is much more flexible than using puts.
